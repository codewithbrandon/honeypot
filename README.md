# honeypot

## Objective

The Cloud-Native Threat Detection Lab project aimed to establish a high-interaction, open-source Honeypot environment to passively collect and analyze real-world threat intelligence. The primary goal was to deploy TPOT (The Honeypot Project) onto a DigitalOcean Droplet to Establish a secure, external-facing server for attracting adversarial traffic

### Skills Learned


- Cloud Deployment & Administration: Provisioning and securing a Linux server (Droplet) on the DigitalOcean platform.
- Linux Security Hardening: Creating non-root users and ensuring system packages are up-to-date prior to deployment.
- Elastic Stack Mastery: Proficiency in utilizing Kibana dashboards (via TPOT) to visualize and analyze real-time malicious traffic.
- Honeypot Technology: Practical installation and configuration of the multi-honeypot system using Docker.
- Network Security: Identifying and changing default SSH port configurations post-installation for enhanced security.

### Tools Used

- Cloud Infrastructure: DigitalOcean (Droplet), running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.
- Honeypot Distribution: TPOT (The Honeypot Project).
- Administration: SSH (Secure Shell) client (PowerShell terminal).
- Software: apt-get, git, adduser, usermod, Kibana, Suricata.
